 * It is a member of the same group as the tasks and does no work of its own, which is
 * the point: something has to execute PHP on a regular tick for a pending signal handler
 * to run at all, and something has to poll the control channel. A pool whose tasks were
 * all parked in Go would notice neither.
 *
 * It never touches a task's coroutine — nothing can. It writes to the shared state, and
 * each task's loop reads it between ticks. The one forcible tool is unwinding the whole
 * group, which is why it is the last resort and why it is only ever used on a full stop.
