/**
 * The pool's only pause. Native sleep() would freeze the process — every coroutine of
 * it, not just the caller — so the wait goes through Sleeper, which suspends the calling
 * coroutine and lets the scheduler run everything else.
 *
 * The wait is cut into chunks for two reasons. A pause has to end early when what it was
 * waiting for is over (a task deactivated mid-sleep should not hold the shutdown for its
 * full interval), and PHP has to reach an opcode boundary regularly for a pending signal
 * handler to run at all — a process whose coroutines are all parked in Go executes no PHP
 * and would not see SIGTERM. The servers of the library poll on the same 250 ms for the
 * same reason.
