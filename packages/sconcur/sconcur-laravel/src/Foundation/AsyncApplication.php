/**
 * Coroutine-scoped application: a single shared container whose request-scoped
 * services are resolved from the current coroutine's context instead of being
 * cloned/swapped per request.
 *
 * There is no mode to turn on. It used to have one, and the switch was the bug: it had to
 * be thrown by whoever knew the process would run coroutines, which meant three call
 * sites, one of which (the task pool) never did it — and before that, a check on argv
 * that stopped matching the moment the master began passing a group's flags ahead of the
 * command name. Nothing detects anything now.
 *
 * Outside a coroutine this costs nothing: there is one caller, so a scoped service is a
 * single instance — which is what the container would have given anyway. It is kept in a
 * store of this object's own rather than in the coroutine context, because the context
 * outside a fiber is the process root, and every coroutine reads through to that.
 *
 * Ported from yangusik/laravel-spawn (AsyncApplication), adapted to SConcur's
 * Context::current(). See docs/fiber-safe-laravel-bridge.ru.md §4.
