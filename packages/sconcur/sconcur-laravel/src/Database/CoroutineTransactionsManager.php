/**
 * The transactions manager, one per coroutine instead of one per process.
 *
 * Laravel binds `db.transactions` as a singleton and every connection is handed that one
 * instance, which keeps its pending and committed records in three properties keyed by
 * connection name — not by whoever opened the transaction. Under coroutines two of them
 * on the same connection are indistinguishable to it: coroutine A's commit calls
 * stageTransactions() for that connection name and then runs executeCallbacks() on
 * everything staged, B's records among them, while B's transaction is still open. A
 * rollback is worse — removeAllTransactionsForConnection() fires every other coroutine's
 * rollback callbacks.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical bookkeeping: Model::saveOrFail() is a transaction, so an
 * ordinary create on a busy connection drives it.
 *
 * The state cannot be moved into the context field by field. Callbacks run inside these
 * methods, and a callback may dispatch a job or write to Mongo — a suspension point — so
 * loading state at the top and storing it at the bottom would let a neighbour overwrite
 * it in between. Instead each coroutine gets a whole manager of its own and this object,
 * the one the container hands out, only routes to it. Reads walk up the context chain, so
 * a coroutine spawned inside a transaction shares its parent's manager, exactly as it
 * shares the transaction itself.

     * which is the failure this class exists to prevent. Without fibers there is one
     * caller, so one manager is exactly right — and it makes the class safe to register
     * in a process that never starts a coroutine.
