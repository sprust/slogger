/**
 * The open transaction of the calling coroutine, held in the coroutine context.
 *
 * Illuminate keeps the nesting depth in Connection::$transactions, a property of
 * an object that here serves every coroutine in the process, so it cannot stay
 * there. TransactionStore is the right place: inside a coroutine it is the coroutine
 * context, where reads walk up the chain of spawning coroutines and writes land in the
 * caller's own map; outside one it is a plain array, so a synchronous caller cannot leave
 * a transaction behind for every future coroutine to inherit.
 *
 * That gives two properties for free. Sibling coroutines — concurrent HTTP
 * requests, concurrent jobs — never see each other's transaction, because they
 * are siblings and not ancestors. A coroutine spawned inside a transaction does
 * see it and its statements join it, which is what makes a WaitGroup inside
 * DB::transaction() atomic instead of quietly autocommitting beside it.
 *
 * What the context does not give is a shared write: a coroutine that inherited
 * the transaction and committed it would leave the opener's own entry in place,
 * pointing at a finished transaction. Hence the owner recorded in
 * TransactionState and the check on every operation that closes the root level.
