/**
 * Laravel service provider for the SConcur integration.
 *
 * Always: registers the artisan commands, the `sconcur_rabbitmq` queue connector, the
 * `sconcur_mysql` database driver and the coroutine-scoped transactions manager. None of
 * them depends on the process being a coroutine one — the SQL feature works synchronously
 * too, so which connection an application uses is its own choice, made in
 * config/database.php like any other.
 *
 * The config is published, not merged. Merging would leave the package's own defaults
 * standing behind the application's file, so a value the application deleted would
 * quietly come back — and the package would have to carry defaults for things only the
 * application knows, such as which queues to consume. Publish it with
 * `vendor:publish --tag=sconcur-laravel`; without it config('sconcur') is empty and the
 * commands say so rather than running on someone else's numbers.
 * The application is coroutine-scoped in every process, with nothing to turn on and
 * nothing to detect: config, events, router, translator and view are swapped for their
 * coroutine-safe adapters, and the container resolves request/session/auth/cookie per
 * coroutine. Each of them keeps its state in the coroutine context, which outside a
 * coroutine is the process root — a single store for a single caller, which is exactly
 * what the stock implementations are.
 *
 * See docs/fiber-safe-laravel-bridge.ru.md.
